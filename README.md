# ip-address-tracker

This is my solution to the [IP Address Tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

### The challenge

In this challenge, I used two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app.

### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- [IP Geolocation API by IPIFY](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- [Leaflet.js an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps](https://leafletjs.com/)
